- Always reference the instructions in this file when generating code or explanations.
- Adhere to the project's coding style and structure as described in the documentation and existing files.
- If unsure about a decision, prefer clarity and maintainability.
- Do not add or suggest tests unless explicitly requested.
- When editing or creating files, use concise comments to indicate unchanged code (e.g., `# ...existing code...`).
