# AI Code Review: ha-torque-2.0 Repository

## General Observations

- The repository follows Home Assistant's custom component structure, with the main integration code in `custom_components/torque/` and developer documentation in `dev-docs/`.
- Python files use modern async patterns and Home Assistant's async setup methods.
- The presence of `config_flow.py` and `options_flow.py` indicates support for UI-based configuration, which is recommended.
- Developer documentation is well-organized, with a dedicated `dev-docs` directory and subfolders for Home Assistant API, architecture, and more.

## Code Quality & Best Practices

### Python Code

- **Type Hints**: Ensure all functions and methods use type hints for parameters and return values. This improves readability and helps with static analysis.
- **Async Usage**: The use of `async_setup_entry`, `async_unload_entry`, and `async_add_entities` is correct and aligns with Home Assistant's async-first approach.
- **Imports**: Prefer explicit imports from Home Assistant's core libraries. Avoid wildcard imports.
- **Constants**: Use the `const.py` file for all string literals and configuration keys to avoid duplication and typos.
- **Docstrings**: Add Google-style or Home Assistant-style docstrings to all public classes and functions for clarity.
- **Error Handling**: Ensure robust error handling, especially for I/O operations and external API calls. Use Home Assistant's logging facilities for warnings and errors.

### Home Assistant Integration

- **Config Flow**: The presence of `config_flow.py` and `options_flow.py` is good. Ensure all user-facing strings are localized using Home Assistant's translation system.
- **Entities**: In `sensor.py`, ensure all entities have unique IDs, proper device classes, and state attributes as per Home Assistant's entity model.
- **Manifest**: The `manifest.json` should accurately declare all dependencies, requirements, and supported platforms.
- **Testing**: The `tests/` directory exists. Ensure it contains tests for config flows, options flows, and entity behavior using pytest and Home Assistant test utilities.

### Documentation

- **Developer Docs**: The `dev-docs/` directory is well-structured. Consider adding more integration-specific developer notes, such as architecture decisions or known limitations.
- **User Docs**: Ensure the main `README.md` provides clear setup instructions, feature overview, and troubleshooting tips for end users.

### Linting & Formatting

- **Ruff & Black**: Ensure both tools are configured and run before commits. This enforces consistent code style and catches common issues early.

### Dependency Management

- **Requirements**: Only include necessary dependencies in `manifest.json`. Use Home Assistant's built-in utilities whenever possible.

## Recommendations

1. **Add/Expand Type Hints**: Review all Python files and add type hints where missing.
2. **Enhance Docstrings**: Add or expand docstrings for all classes, methods, and functions.
3. **Improve Error Handling**: Audit for unhandled exceptions, especially in async functions and I/O.
4. **Expand Tests**: Ensure comprehensive test coverage, especially for config flows and entity state changes.
5. **Localization**: Use Home Assistant's translation system for all user-facing strings.
6. **Documentation**: Keep both developer and user documentation up to date as the integration evolves.
